# Observation #1

For the most part the sentiment plots are well distributed on the scatterplot.  However, many of the tweets have a compound or polarity rating of 0.  

# Take the main DataFrame and calculate the mean compound rating of the tweets for each news agency.  Plot the mean compound score for each news agency.


```python
# Get the mean sentiment for each target_user
# Only compound sentiment is needed but I wanted to see all sentiment averages
mean_values = pd.pivot_table(sentiments_pd, index = ["News Agency"],
                                   values = ("Compound", "Positive", "Neutral", "Negative"), aggfunc=np.mean)

# Flattenning the header to clean up the dataframe for mean values
mean_sentiment = pd.DataFrame(mean_values.to_records())
mean_sentiment = mean_sentiment[["News Agency", "Compound", "Positive", "Neutral", "Negative"]]
mean_sentiment

# Observaton #2

All of the news agencies have an overall negative sentiment rating for the last 100 tweets, which results in a negative compound mean.


```python
# Create bar chart for mean sentiment by News Agency
sns.barplot(x = 'News Agency', y = 'Compound', data = mean_sentiment, label = 'News Agency')
plt.title("Overall Media Sentiment based on Twitter")
plt.xlabel("News Agency")
plt.ylabel("Tweet Polarity")
plt.savefig("News_Agency_Sentiment")
plt.show()
```


![png](output_9_0.png)


# Observation #3

The most negative of the five news agencies is BBC News.  I am not sure if this is because news reporting in the UK tends to have a more negative slant or if perhaps the more proper English of the BBC tweets garners a more negative sentiment score.  I ran this analysis on different days and the results were essentially the same.
